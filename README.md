# 🖨️ Printing Task Scheduler using FCFS

This project implements a **Printing Task Scheduler** using the **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm in Python. It simulates how a printer handles print jobs based on their arrival time.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Imagine a printer queue where multiple print jobs arrive at different times. This program helps:
- Schedule those tasks using FCFS
- Calculate their waiting and turnaround times
- Display results in a clean table

## 📥 Inputs Required

- Arrival Time (when the print job is submitted)
- Burst Time (how long the print takes)

## 📤 Outputs Displayed

- Completion Time
- Turnaround Time
- Waiting Time
- Average Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround Time

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Takes number of tasks and their arrival/burst times
2. Sorts jobs by arrival time (FCFS)
3. Calculates completion, turnaround, and waiting times
4. Prints results in tabular form
